## User Story
```
As a user, I want to log my activities so that I can track my progress. Hence, I go to [url] and see a sign up/ login modal.
I sign up using my email as my username and password. 
After log in, I land on an empty dashboard. 
Then, I am prompted to log my first activity in any given categories: cardio, mindfulness or strength.
First, I put a brief description of my activity.
Then, I log the time (duration) of the activity.
When I click on "next", I am prompted to input my mood, ranging from "Not Well" to "Great".
Then, I choose my mood and complete the form.
I am directed back to my dashbood and see my activity logged on a calendar graph.
Now, I totally lived!
